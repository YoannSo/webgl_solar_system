>## Project:
For this project we had to design a solar system using threeJS (Javascript library). Once we had the basic structure up and running we each focused on our own planets with custom textures.

Completed in the third year of my Computer Science degree at the F.S.T Limoges (France) with Yoann SOCHAJ and Benjamin MAUREL.

Class: WebGL

>## Features:
- User controlled camera
- Control menu (speed and rotations of each planet)
- Custom 3D Textures

>## Technology used:
